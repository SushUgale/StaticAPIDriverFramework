# StaticAPIDriverFramework
I have created Static Driver Framework using restAssured, TestNG, and JsonPATH to automate Rest API's.

Project Features:
I have divided the project into 4 Packages, i.e (Common_Api_Method, Request_Repository, Driver_Packaage, TestClass).
In Test Class I validate requestBody and responseBody. Using Driver Class I execute Static Framework.
